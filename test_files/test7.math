CalcuLaTeX:

Write an expression followed by = ? to evaluate it:
'''

50 g + 1 kg = ?

'''
You can suggest a unit if it outputs the wrong one. \\
Make sure it's correct otherwise the document won't \\
compile!
'''

5 m/s^2 * 3 kg = ?
5 m/s^2 * 3 kg = ? N

'''
Assign variables with =
'''
x = 5
y = 10 kg
x * y = ?
z = x kg + y = ?

'''
Set the output digits or use scientific notation \\
by using !digits \{n\} or !scientific 
'''

1 / 3 = ?

!digits 10
1 / 3 = ?

!digits 1
!scientific
1 kg = ? mg

'''
Escape raw latex with three single quotes.
