CalcuLaTeX:

Write an expression followed by = ? to evaluate it:
'''

50 g + 1 kg = ?

'''
You can suggest a unit if it outputs the wrong one. \\
Make sure it's correct otherwise the document won't \\
compile!
'''

5 m/s^2 * 3 kg = ?
5 m/s^2 * 3 kg = ? N

'''
Assign variables with =

They support some LaTeX formatting
'''
a_b = 5
c = 10 kg
a_b * c = ?
z = a_b kg + c = ?

'''
You can also add aliases for hard to type variables
'''
alias dx \frac{dx}{dt}
alias dt \Delta{t}

dx = 10 m/s
dt = 14 days
x = dx * dt = ?

'''
Set the output digits or use scientific notation \\
by using !digits \{n\} or !scientific 
'''

1 / 3 = ?

!digits 10
1 / 3 = ?

!digits 1
!scientific
1 kg = ? mg

'''
Basic mathematical functions are supported.

Additionally, builtin constants include $\pi$ and $e$.
'''

sin(\pi) = ?
cos(\pi) = ?
e = ?

'''
Escape raw latex with three single quotes.
